The Collatz conjecture explores whether every positive integer can be transformed into 1 by repeating two arithmetic operations.
The user can input what integer to start with.
If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. 
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
